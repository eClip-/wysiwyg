# /assets
Place your dependencies and assets here.

## Attention
Contrary to common practice you need to commit all files you want to access in your components â€“ even stuff like `bower_components` or `node_modules`.

Nonetheless, we encourage you to use Grunt to build (and minify, compress,...) the files you want to store in */assets*. This way you can stick to your usual workflow with **npm** or **Bower**.
